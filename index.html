      A Web Server for Chrome, serves web pages from a local folder over the
      network, using HTTP. Runs offline.
      Web Server for Chrome is an open source (MIT) HTTP server for Chrome.
      It runs anywhere that you have Chrome installed, so you can take it
      anywhere. It even works on ARM chromebooks.
      It now has the option to listen on the local network,
      so other computers can access your files. Additionally,
      it can try and get an internet address.
      Many people use this to do basic web development on a chromebook.
      It is also handy for sharing files over a local network between
      computers, or even on the internet.
